# copy_moveFrogeryDetection
Image forgery is the manipulation or the adulteration of the digital image to conceal useful
information of the image. The project uses deep learning approach (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network) to extract complex statistical feature from high dimensional data. An endeavor is prepared to review advanced picture fraud detection by various copy-move detection methods based on their robustness and computational complexity and accuracy. The architecture and model uses  deep learning â€“ based method, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
